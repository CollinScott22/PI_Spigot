# PI_Spigot

This is a program to generate numbers of Pi using a Spigot algorithm
This program is designed to be unbounded.
The program itself is from a paper about unbounded Spigot algorithms that I read recently.
The paper goes through why it works and gives a description of pseudocode in Haskell

Here is the paper:
